Integration layer for running BPM on Discord

This code should be injected as a dependency into `app.asar`'s
`node_modules` folder, and a dependency to it should be added
to `package.json`.  You can enable a development console by
uncommenting the `openDevConsole()` line found in `bpm.js`.

This layer should really just handle loading the scripts into
Discord's Electron environment.  The rest of the magic happens
inside BPM code proper (either under `discord-ext` specific cases
or inside files flagged `dc-THING`).
