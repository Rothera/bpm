        <h2>Better Ponymotes <small>(current release: <strong>v24.48</strong>)</small></h2>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Better Ponymotes is a browser addon to display ponymotes across Reddit.
        This means things like <code>[]<!---->(/c01)</code> will work outside of
        <a href="http://reddit.com/r/mylittlepony">r/mylittlepony</a>, but also that
        ponymotes from other subreddits (such as <code>[]<!---->(/rose6)</code>) will work
        across the site.

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p><b>Over seventy subreddits and 6,500 emotes.</b> Never miss another
        hidden emote.

        <p><b>Powerful built in search.</b> Search by name or by subreddit- every
        emote at your fingertips.

        <p><b>Global emotes.</b> Use emotes outside of Reddit!

        <p><b>Flexible and configurable.</b> Choose which emotes or subreddits
        you want to see.

        <p><b>Alt-text reveal.</b> Shows hover text hidden on emotes, so you don't
        have to.

        <p><b>Easy configuration.</b> Every option easily accessible.

        <p><b>Chaos script built in.</b> Rotate, flip, and spin flags.

        <p><b>Emote click blocker.</b>

        <!-- Yeah. I went there. -->
        <p><b>Solid and stable.</b> Bugs happen, but BetterPonymotes is thoroughly
        tested before every release. Secure and careful coding means Derpy can't
        accidentally mess it up.

        <p><b>Native addon.</b> BetterPonymotes integrates with your browser
        better than any userscript can.

        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <h4>Firefox Installation</h4>
        <img src="images/firefox-logo.png">
        <p>Install the addon from <a href="betterponymotes.xpi"><code>betterponymotes.xpi</code></a>.

        <p>Firefox should handle the file automatically. If not, download the
        file and drag it onto Firefox.

        <h4>Chrome Installation</h4>
        <img src="images/chrome-logo.png">
        <p>Install the addon from <a href="betterponymotes.crx"><code>betterponymotes.crx</code></a>.

        <p>Newer versions of Chrome will not install extensions that are not
        hosted by the Chrome Web Store. Since BetterPonymotes isn't available
        in the webstore, you must download the file and drag it onto the
        extensions page. Click wrench icon -> Settings, and go to the Extensions
        tab on the left.

        <h4>Opera Installation</h4>
        <img src="images/opera-logo.png">
        <p>Install the addon from <a href="betterponymotes.oex"><code>betterponymotes.oex</code></a>.

        <p>Opera should handle the file automatically. If not, download the file
        and drag it onto the Extensions page at Opera -> Extensions -> Manage
        Extensions.

        <h4>Safari Installation</h4>
        <p>Sorry! No support for Safari yet. Maybe <a href="http://nallar.me/scripts/">GrEmB</a> can help you?

        <h3>Updates</h3>
        <p>BetterPonymotes is periodically updated with the latest emotes and
        features. Your browser will download these automatically.

        <p>Though you do not need to restart your browser for updates, you will
        need to reload any open pages before the update can take effect. This
        includes new ponymotes.

        <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <p>BetterPonymotes has a built in page for configuration. Follow the
        instructions for your browser to find it.

        <h4>Firefox Preferences</h4>
        <p>Go to the Addons Manager (<code>about:addons</code>, Ctrl-Shift-A,
        or Firefox menu -> Add-ons), locate Better Ponymotes in the list, and
        click the "Preferences" button. Then click the second "Preferences"
        button.

        <h4>Chrome Preferences</h4>
        <p>Go to the Extensions page (<code>chrome:extensions</code>, or Wrench menu
        -> Settings, then click Extensions on the left), locate Better Ponymotes in
        the list, and click the "Options" link.

        <h4>Opera Preferences</h4>
        <p>Go to the Extensions page (Opera -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions),
        locate Better Ponymotes in the list, and click the Wrench icon -> Preferences.

        <h3>Available Options</h3>
        <p>Preference changes require page reloads to take effect.

        <h5>Enable NSFW Emotes</h5>
        <p>This option does as it says- enables or disables display of a handful
        of questionable ponymotes. These aren't used very frequently across Reddit
        (especially the pony subreddits, which tend toward being more SFW), but
        be warned that some of them are <em>very</em> explicit. Enable with
        discretion.

        <p>When disabled, NSFW emotes will display as a placeholder small black box.

        <h5>Enable Extra CSS</h5>
        <p>This option enables the "chaos script", a collection of emote flags
        and modifiers such as <code>-zspin</code>, which apply various CSS
        transformations. You may want to disable this if your computer is less
        capable of handling them, as they're known to bog down browsers.

        <p>(Note: Most of these do not work in Opera, which lacks support for 3d
        transformations and is limited in what 2d transformations it will accept.)

        <h5>Show Placeholders For Unknown Emotes</h5>
        <p>When BPM finds an emote that it doesn't recognize, it can optionally
        generate a placeholder so that it's still visible. Unfortunately, this
        feature doesn't always work well when you use other emote scripts at the
        same time. Since BPM doesn't know about these other scripts, it will
        sometimes mark emotes as "Unknown" when it shouldn't.

        <p>If BPM is conflicting in this manner, you are recommended to disable
        this option. If ensuring unknown emotes still show up is important to you,
        however, you can use something like Arbitrary Entity's
        <a href="https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/117720">Reddit Show Hidden Emotes</a>
        script, which can be configured to run last.

        <h5>Reveal Hidden Alt-Text</h5>
        <p>Emotes often have hidden text that can be seen by hovering over them.
        This option shows the text inline, so you don't have to.

        <p>You may wish to disable this option if you prefer an alternate
        alt-text script, since running both at once will conflict.

        <h5>Global Emote Conversion</h5>
        <p>The <code>Convert emotes outside of Reddit</code> option enables
        Global Emotes, a feature that replaces emote text on all websites.
        It works as if BPM were running everywhere, not just Reddit.

        <h5>Search Result Limit</h5>
        <p>This option controls the maximum number of search results that the
        built in search tool will return. There are no limits on this field, but
        search queries with large results counts will take a long time to
        complete if this number is set too high, freezing your browser while it
        works.

        <p>A conservative recommended value is a few hundred.

        <h5>Max Emote Size</h5>
        <p>Any emote with a height or width larger than this option, measured in
        pixels, will not be displayed. A value of <code>0</code> will display
        all emotes.

        <p>When an emote is blocked in this manner, its will display as a small
        red box.

        <h4>Enabled Subreddits</h4>
        <p>You may enable or disable emotes from entire subreddits by checking
        the appropriate box.

        <p>When a subreddit is disabled, its emotes will display as a small
        red box.

        <h4>Disabled Emotes</h4>
        <p>You may disable specific emotes by listing them here. Click anywhere
        within the box and begin typing. Pressing Enter or <code>,</code> will
        accept the value and start a new one.

        <p>When an emote is disabled, its will display as a small red box.

        <h4>Whitelisted Emotes</h4>
        <p>Emotes listed here will be displayed regardless of NSFW setting,
        disabled subreddits, size limitations, or otherwise.

        <h4>Custom Subreddits</h4>
        <p>BetterPonymotes will download and apply raw CSS from this list of
        subreddits. This allows you to view emotes from subreddits that BPM does
        not natively support.
        <p><strong>Caveats:</strong> BPM tries to remove all non-emote CSS, but
        its method is not perfect. Though unlikely, it is possible for unwanted
        extra CSS to slip in and be applied to all pages. Emotes added in this
        manner will not show up in search, and do not work globally.
        <p>The CSS cache is updated on a weekly basis. This is not currently
        configurable.
        <p><strong>The custom CSS feature is still in progress, and should not
        be used extensively. There are a number of known bugs.</strong>
